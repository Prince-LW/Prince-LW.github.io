A simple single pager built around an angular motif (powered by SVG awesomeness).
Should work great for a landing page. Also includes default styling for a bunch of
standard page elements (uncomment the huge block of commented-out HTML to see it).


Feedback, bug reports, and comments are not only welcome, but strongly encouraged :)
